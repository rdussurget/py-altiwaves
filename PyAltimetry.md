# Introduction #

PyAltimetry package is a package dedicated to altimetry data analysis (and more)


# Details #

PyAltiwaves requires PyAltimetry to run properly (specially to load data and for specific steps of the data processing). It therefore need to be installed before running PyAltiwaves (visit [PyAltimetry page](https://code.google.com/p/py-altimetry/)).

This step is automatically done when installing PyAltiwaves from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-altiwaves).
